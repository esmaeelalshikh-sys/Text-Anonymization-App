# Text-Anonymization-App
Introduction..........................................................................................................................
This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit for anonymizing sensitive information within text documents. Leveraging advanced Named-Entity Recognition (NER) models from the Hugging Face transformers library, the app automatically detects and replaces personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, organizations, and locations with realistic, fake data to protect privacy.

Key Features...........................................................................................................................
Intelligent Anonymization: Uses a pre-trained BERT-based NER model to accurately identify names, organizations, and locations.
Dynamic Replacement: Replaces detected entities with contextually relevant, fake data generated by the Faker library.
Multi-Format Support: Accepts and processes text files (.txt), Word documents (.docx), and PDF files (.pdf).
Interactive Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit for easy file uploads and processing.
Download Functionality: Allows users to download the anonymized text as a new .txt or .docx file.

How to Run..............................................................................................................................
The easiest way to run this application is directly from a Google Colab notebook. The provided code is specifically configured to handle the setup and a live demo link using Ngrok.

Step 1: Set up Ngrok Authentication
Go to the Google Colab notebook interface.
Click on the ðŸ”‘ icon (Secrets) on the left sidebar.
Click "Enable secrets in this notebook".
Add a new secret with the name NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN.
Paste your ngrok authentication token as the value. You can find this token on your Ngrok dashboard.

Step 2: Run the Code
Copy all the provided code into a new cell in your Colab notebook.
Run the cell.
The script will automatically install all necessary libraries, create the app.py file, and launch the Streamlit app. It will then generate a public ngrok URL that you can click to access the live application in your browser.

Technologies Used........................................................................................................................
Python
Streamlit: For the web interface.
Hugging Face transformers: For the NER model.
PyPDF2 & python-docx: For reading different file formats.
Faker: For generating fake data.
pyngrok: To create a public URL for the app from Colab.
